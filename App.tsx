            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-mercury-black mb-2 mt-4 font-serif">Understanding CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average)</h3>
            <p className="mb-2">
              CGPA represents your overall academic performance across all semesters completed in your course. It's a weighted average of the grade points you've earned, providing a holistic view of your academic standing. Many universities and employers use CGPA as a primary indicator of academic success.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-mercury-black mb-2 mt-4 font-serif">What is SGPA (Semester Grade Point Average)?</h3>
            <p className="mb-2">
              SGPA, or Semester Grade Point Average, is a measure of your academic performance within a single semester. It's calculated based on the grades and credit hours of the courses you took during that specific academic term. Our Grade Point Calculator helps you easily compute your SGPA for each semester.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-mercury-black mb-2 mt-4 font-serif">Why Track Your SGPA & CGPA?</h3>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 mb-3 pl-2">
              <li><strong>Monitor Progress:</strong> Regularly calculating your SGPA helps you understand your performance in each semester, allowing you to identify strengths and areas for improvement.</li>

            <p className="mb-2 p-3 bg-academic-blue-light/50 border-l-4 border-academic-blue rounded-md">
              <strong>Important Note:</strong> Conversion formulas (multipliers or divisors) can vary significantly between universities, educational boards, and countries. While this tool offers customizable conversion factors based on common standards (e.g., multiplying by 9.5 for a 10-point scale, or 25 for a 4-point scale), <strong>always confirm with your specific institution for their official conversion methodology.</strong>
